# ClayHack-Speed-Run
Welcome to our mini web-browser game! In this little black and white world, infinitely dodge moving ghosties for a lifetime. To see some of our inspiration, browse the sources below.

Inspired by https://codepen.io/EduardoLopes/pen/vYWpLQ, with some functional inspiration by https://www.codewizardshq.com/javascript-games/gi and https://blog.logrocket.com/build-a-game-with-html-css-javascript/

All of our art was done by Jackie and Jolin during the coding period of the Hackathon.
All of our code was written by all four of us during the 7 and a half hours of Clayhack!

Thank you for checking out our game!
